Hey there. I'm a Brit living in Portugal. I'm a designer, developer, entrepreneur and startup consultant. 

I run several business projects in the fields of design, development and content creation. At Compelling Ideas we design wonderful things to help startups and organizations communicate better. Check us out at compellingideas.net 

I’m excited to play a part in growing the innovation ecosystem in Portugal. I try to add value with creative ideas, strategic thinking, making connections and helping entrepreneurs maximise their potential. I am also keen to bring fresh thinking and change to the ecosystem on the subjects of diversity, minority representation, and mental health for founders.

In 2017 I created the events listing platform InnovationScene.pt – a startup events guide for Portugal. Since its launch, Innovation Scene has featured over 16,000 tech, startup and business events across Portugal and is now the go-to platform for startup events in PT.

Other projects include the Portugal Startup Directory, a mental health resource kit and an online startup studio. 

For two years I was part of the team running 351 Community – a grassroots association of founders, investors and contributors to the Portuguese startup ecosystem. By focusing on community engagement and membership management, I helped day-to-day to support founders and assist with problem-solving and advice. I also created the 351 branding and designed the logo. 

I have participated in various accelerator programmes and courses including Tourism Explorers, TSN, YC’s Startup School and Tech Stars Toolkit course. Future projects include Portugal-specific innovation platforms and some potential startups.
