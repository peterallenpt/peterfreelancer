Hey there. I'm a Brit living in Portugal. I'm a designer, developer, entrepreneur and startup consultant. 

I run several business projects in the fields of design, development and content creation. At Compelling Ideas we design wonderful things to help startups and organizations communicate better. Check us out at compellingideas.net 

As a startup enthusiast in Portugal, I’m excited to play a part in growing the innovation ecosystem here. I try to add value with creative ideas, strategic thinking, making connections and helping entrepreneurs maximise their potential. I am also keen to bring fresh thinking and change to the ecosystem on the subjects of diversity, minority representation, and mental health.

In 2017 I created the events listing platform InnovationScene.pt – a startup events guide for Portugal. Since its launch, Innovation Scene has featured over 16,000 tech, startup and business events across Portugal and is now recognised at the go-to place to discover startup events in PT.

Other projects include the Portugal Startup Directory, a mental health resource kit and an online startup studio. 

For two years I was part of the team running 351 Community – a grassroots association of founders, investors and contributors to the Portuguese startup ecosystem. My role is focused on member support and community engagement. I also created the 351 brand and designed the logo. At 351 we offer support, networking, mentorship and practical assistance to founders of all stages. 

I have participated in various accelerator programmes and courses including Tourism Explorers, TSN, YC’s Startup School and Tech Stars Toolkit course. Future projects include Portugal-specific innovation platforms and some potential startups.

With a background in graphic design and web development, I've worked as a freelance creative and technical problem-solver on hundreds of projects for global brands at top London agencies such as Radley Yeldar, Imagination, GOOD and Hogarth Worldwide as well as corporate and government environments.

I'm an expert Creative Suite user (print, digital and motion) and full stack developer (html, js, php, sql). I build fast, light and accessible sites and powerful web apps. 

I'm always open to hearing about new projects. Contact me for a chat. No recruitment agencies please.
